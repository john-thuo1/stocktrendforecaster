# stocktrendforecaster
This Streamlit application & code implements a simple stocktrendforecasting tool that allows users to explore and analyze stock market trends, perform trend forecasting using an LSTM model and the stock's closing price, analyze historical volatility of the given stock in a 21 Day window, and visualize simple moving averages(SMA) for a selected stock within 100 and 200 Day Windows. The moving average smoothens out short-term fluctuations and highlights longer-term trends. Traders and analysts often use moving averages in technical analysis to identify trends in financial markets or other time-series data.
